            <p>
              <abbr>deal.II</abbr> is a community project that lives
              by the participation of its members &mdash; i.e., including
              you! If you want to join us in this, here are a few ways to
              give back to the project:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
		All development happens in the open in our 
		<a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii">GitHub</a>
		repository. You can participate in the development in many
		different ways.
              </li>

                Subscribe to the <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a> and
                help by answering questions by others to which you happen to
                know the answers.
              </li>

	      <li>
                Join our deal.II element chat 
		<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dealii:matrix.org">#dealii:matrix.org</a> at deal.II.

              </li>


	      <li>
                Suggest improvements to the documentation. Most
                documentation is written by those who already know what a
                function or class does, and may miss crucial pieces
                those still learning it may find necessary. If you have
                understood something that was awkwardly or incompletely
                documented, re-write this documentation and submit the new
                text for inclusion.
              </li>

              <li>
                Report any <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues">bugs</a>
                you may find.
              </li>

              <li>
                Download the sources from our
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii">github</a>
                repository. See the <a href="/download.html">download page</a>
                for instructions.
              </li>

              <li>
                Contribute to the project in one of many ways! An excellent
                overview of some steps is given <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/Contributing">here</a>.
                If you're interested in submitting patches but don't
                know how,
                see also <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.html">video

                Most people contribute patches that add functionality
                they need, or fix bugs they run into. But there may be
                easier ways to start.
                Some easy enhancement projects are described on the 
                <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues">list
                  of open issues</a> (and in particular in our list of
                  <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Starter+project%22">"starter
                projects"</a>). 
                There is also a <a href="ideas.html">list of ideas for larger projects</a>. 
                Even simpler, most projects based on <abbr>deal.II</abbr>
                have functions that, with small modifications, may be of
                general interest. If you have any functions you think
                others might find useful, please offer them for inclusion
                into the library!
