                Given that we can't have in-person workshops this
                year, we will have a 1-day public day with talks
                discussing what's new in deal.II. For more

              </dt>
              <dd>
                Over the past year, many new tutorial programs have
                been merged -- a total of ten, more than for any
                previous release of deal.II!

                <br>

                Specifically, these are <a href="https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html">the new
                  programs</a>:
                step-19 introduces particle methods,
                and step-68 uses these for tracking locations in a flow
                field. step-66 is a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver for a
                nonlinear problem. step-71 and step-72 illustrate automatic and
                symbolic differentiation. step-77 demonstrates deal.II's SUNDIALS
                interfaces to solve a nonlinear problem. step-74 shows the SIPG
                approach to discontinuous Galerkin methods. step-76 is an explicit
                integrator for the Euler equations. step-78 solves the
                Black-Scholes equations, and step-79 solves a topology
                optimization problem.

                deal.II, like many other computational math software

                summer school targeted primarily at young
                scientists from underrepresented groups in our
                community. See

                Because the global dof index variables in deal.II were of type

                more than half a year, consists of more than 10,000 lines, and
                touches every aspect of the installation process. It provides a more
                modern interface to and more reliable way of interacting with other

                therefore integrates more easily with integrated development

                The step-21 tutorial program was the first program in the

                Step-15 used to be a program that demonstrated techniques for solving
                a rather quirky, nonlinear, 1d problem. It was an interesting problem,
                but it served little purpose in teaching deal.II or in demonstrating
                nonlinear solution techniques. It has now been replaced by a more
                illustrative example, contributed in large part by Sven Wetterauer, in
                which we solve the nonlinear elliptic minimal surface equation using a

                A matrix-free framework has been contributed by Katharina

                processors' vector units. The two new tutorial programs step-37
                (multigrid solver) and step-48 (nonlinear wave equation with

                free-energy function. The geometrical response is also
                nonlinear, i.e., the program considers finite deformations.

                step-41, a program contributed by J&ouml;rg Frohne, shows

                the deformation of a body subject to an inequality
                constraint that arises from the fact that the deformation is
                constrained by contact of the body with some external
                obstacle. The program uses the primal-dual active set method

                and the solid displacement) do not live on the entire domain, but
                only on a part. The point of the program is how to represent this in

                deal.II has had a somewhat quirky directory and library structure for
                historical reasons, but this has now changed: All include and source
                files are now under the top-level <code>include/</code>
                and <code>source</code> directories. Furthermore, we no longer build a
                plethora of libraries but only <code>libdeal_II.g.so</code> (debug
                version) and <code>libdeal_II.so</code> (optimized version). In
                particular, we no longer build different versions of the library for
                different space dimensions.

                After more than 2 years of work by Timo Heister, Martin Kronbichler,
                and Wolfgang Bangerth, and with help by Carsten Burstedde, we have
                merged a branch on which we have implemented the functionality
                necessary to distribute meshes on hundreds, thousands, or more

                in which this is implemented is presented in a documentation module,
                an accompanying paper, as well as in the new step-40 tutorial program.

              <dd>
                Over the last few months, the multigrid implementation has seen
                significant rewrites, with much of the work done by B&auml;rbel
                Janssen. The goal &mdash; now achieved &mdash; was to finally fully
                support multigrid also for continuous finite elements on adaptively
                refined meshes (uniformly refined meshes and discontinuous elements
                have worked for a long time). As part of this process, step-16 has
                been rewritten and now solves the same problem step-6 solves, just
                with a multigrid solver.

                Up to now, in 3D only 'orientable' meshes could be used in
                deal.II, where all lines are in standard orientation and the
                faces can be either in standard orientation or with a
                reversed normal. This has been generalized such that now all
                hexahedral meshes can be used.
