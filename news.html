              <dd>
                Over the past year, many new tutorial programs have
                been merged -- a total of ten, more than for any
                previous release of deal.II!

                <br>

                Specifically, these are <a href="https://dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html">the new
                  programs</a>:
                step-19 introduces particle methods,
                and step-68 uses these for tracking locations in a flow
                field. step-66 is a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver for a
                nonlinear problem. step-71 and step-72 illustrate automatic and
                symbolic differentiation. step-77 demonstrates deal.II's SUNDIALS
                interfaces to solve a nonlinear problem. step-74 shows the SIPG
                approach to discontinuous Galerkin methods. step-76 is an explicit
                integrator for the Euler equations. step-78 solves the
                Black-Scholes equations, and step-79 solves a topology
                optimization problem.

                Because the global dof index variables in deal.II were of type

                long int and thus, allows for 18e18 unknowns.

                contributed by Matthias Maier of Heidelberg University, has taken
                more than half a year, consists of more than 10,000 lines, and
                touches every aspect of the installation process. It provides a more
                modern interface to and more reliable way of interacting with other
                packages. Furthermore, it no longer relies on shell scripts and
                therefore integrates more easily with integrated development

              <dd>
                The step-21 tutorial program was the first program in the

                problems, but it suffered from the fact that it was very
                slow. step-43 demonstrates some of the techniques that can be

                Step-15 used to be a program that demonstrated techniques for solving
                a rather quirky, nonlinear, 1d problem. It was an interesting problem,
                but it served little purpose in teaching deal.II or in demonstrating
                nonlinear solution techniques. It has now been replaced by a more
                illustrative example, contributed in large part by Sven Wetterauer, in
                which we solve the nonlinear elliptic minimal surface equation using a

                A matrix-free framework has been contributed by Katharina

                efficient and includes parallelism via MPI for distributed
                meshes, threads for shared-memory computations, and usage of
                processors' vector units. The two new tutorial programs step-37
                (multigrid solver) and step-48 (nonlinear wave equation with
                distributed grid) demonstrate the new features.

                free-energy function. The geometrical response is also
                nonlinear, i.e., the program considers finite deformations.

                step-41, a program contributed by J&ouml;rg Frohne, shows
                how to solve the obstacle problem. This problem describes
                the deformation of a body subject to an inequality
                constraint that arises from the fact that the deformation is
                constrained by contact of the body with some external
                obstacle. The program uses the primal-dual active set method

                step-46 shows how to couple different models defined on subsets of

                trick here is that variables (here the flow velocity and pressure,
                and the solid displacement) do not live on the entire domain, but
                only on a part. The point of the program is how to represent this in
                source code.

                deal.II has had a somewhat quirky directory and library structure for

                and <code>source</code> directories. Furthermore, we no longer build a

                version) and <code>libdeal_II.so</code> (optimized version). In

                different space dimensions.

                Over the last few months, the multigrid implementation has seen

                Janssen. The goal &mdash; now achieved &mdash; was to finally fully
                support multigrid also for continuous finite elements on adaptively
                refined meshes (uniformly refined meshes and discontinuous elements
                have worked for a long time). As part of this process, step-16 has
                been rewritten and now solves the same problem step-6 solves, just
                with a multigrid solver.

                explains how problems involving complex numbers can be treated in
                <abbr>deal.II</abbr>. In the example,
                the complex-valued solution to a Helmholtz equation is split into
                real and imaginary parts and a vector-valued finite element field
                is used to discretize them seperately. The program also demonstrates
                how quantities derived from the finite element solution can be directly
                included in the output by using the new <code>DataPostprocessor</code>
                class.
